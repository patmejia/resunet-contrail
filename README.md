#  Utilizing Augmented Transfer Learning and Hough Space for Enhanced Detection

### Neural Networks Models for Contrail Detection and Segmentation

#### Project Overview:
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Models**: Utilizes augmented transfer learning on a pre-trained ResUNet model.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Applies augmentations for fine-tuning with limited labeled data.
- **Optimization**: Incorporates **SR Loss** for enhanced contrail detection using Hough space information.

#### Repository Structure:
- **Contents**:
  - `README.md`: Project overview.
  - `data`: Satellite images and model weights.
  - `detect.ipynb`: Contrail detection notebook.
  - `loss.py`: Custom loss functions.
  - `models`: Model definitions.
  - `tensorflow_model`: TensorFlow implementation (not fully tested).
  - `train.py`: Training script.
- **Dependencies**: PyTorch, segmentation_models_pytorch, opencv, scikit-learn
- **Model Weights**: [Download from Surfdrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/n1b0L2qfu2PZ6d3) (from [contrail-net GitHub repository](https://github.com/junzis/contrail-net))

#### Scientific Contributions:
- **Contrail Detection Examples**:
  - Models trained with various loss functions.
  - Validation on diverse image sources.
- **Hough Space and Contrail Detection**:
  - **Hough Space Explanation**: A technique to identify geometric shapes by transforming the image space. Utilized in this project to detect contrail lines.
  - **SR Loss**: Transforms image space into Hough space for better detectionÂ¹.
  - **Innovation**: Detects contrails with minimal dataÂ².
